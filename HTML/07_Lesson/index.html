            <summary>When did Tacos first appeared in United States?</summary>
            <p>
              The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905.
              Mexican migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other
              jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos
              were essentially a street food at this time since they were highly
              portable and cheap.
